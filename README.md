# ML-Toppers
Welcome to ML Toppers — your structured pathway to mastering Machine Learning! 🚀

This repository is designed for learners, enthusiasts, and professionals who want to systematically explore Machine Learning projects from basic to advanced levels. Each day corresponds to a project that builds on previous concepts, helping you grow incrementally and solidify your understanding through hands-on practice.

**📁 Repository Structure**

The repository is organized into folders named Day1, Day2, Day3, ..., each containing a unique ML project. These projects cover essential machine learning techniques, from basic preprocessing to advanced model deployment.
Each folder typically includes:

📄 Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) or Python script

📊 Dataset (or a link to one)

📃 Brief explanation or README

📝 Requirements file (if applicable)

**🎯 Objectives**

Provide a day-wise roadmap of Machine Learning projects.
Help learners move from basic to advanced ML concepts with real-world applications.
Encourage project-based learning for better retention and practical skills.
